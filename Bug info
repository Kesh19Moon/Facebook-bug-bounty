💣 I Broke Facebook’s 2FA for $1,800 — and Laughed My Way Through It
How I (almost) felt like a Hollywood hacker at 3 AM in pajamas.
Let me take you on a ride — a ride that started with curiosity, escalated into chaos, and ended with a modest but memorable $1,800 from Meta.

Yes, I bypassed Facebook’s Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using nothing but patience, coffee, and the kind of thinking that makes you question whether you’ve watched too many hacker movies.

☕ The Setup
It was one of those quiet nights — too late for productivity, too early for sleep. I had my hoodie on, black terminal open, and Mission Impossible music in my head. I was poking around Facebook and Instagram’s login flows (legally, of course 👮‍♂️) when something weird caught my eye.

🤔 "Wait a second..."
So, I noticed something suspicious in Instagram’s sign-up flow. Apparently, if you try to create a new account with the same phone number and password as an existing account… Instagram just lets you log into the existing one.

What?!

It’s like walking up to a security gate, showing your friend’s ID, and the guard says “Ah yes, right this way sir.”

Of course, it wasn’t that easy — turns out this “magic login” only worked on devices and networks already associated with the account. So no, I couldn’t just “create” my way into someone else’s profile.

But that was just the beginning.

🔍 The Digging Begins
Three words: Vulnerable. API. Endpoint.

After hours of digging through request flows, headers, and rate limits, I found a gold nugget in the form of an endpoint that didn’t rate-limit properly. It allowed you to brute-force verification codes when signing up via phone number.

So what did I do?

I made an Instagram account linked to the victim's phone number. This didn’t give me access yet, but it got me one foot inside the door (and earned me a virtual “nice try” reward of around $3,000 if this alone had been new).

But wait… it gets juicier 🍊

🔗 Account Center Magic Trick
Now here’s where the magic happened — and I’m both proud and confused it worked.

I went into accountscenter.facebook.com, linked the newly-created Instagram account (with the victim’s phone number) to my own Facebook account. Facebook said:

“Oh, you already confirmed this number on Instagram? That’s cool. You don’t need to reverify it.”

What?!

Just like that, the victim’s phone number was now mine on Facebook.

Facebook’s logic:

If you link an Instagram account that has a confirmed number…

...we’ll let that number float over to your Facebook account...

...and remove it from the victim's account.

...which disables their 2FA.

Boom. 2FA bypassed.

I could now log into the victim’s Facebook account without ever needing the 2FA code.

🥳 Reporting & The Cash (not quite a mansion)
When I reported the bug, Meta responded:

“Hey, this one’s known. But your exploitation method is creative.”

Translation:

No champagne.

But here’s $1,800 for the clever twist.

I'll take it.

🎓 Takeaways
Creativity > Copy-paste hacks

Known bugs can still yield bounties if your exploitation path is new

Facebook's Account Center was basically the backdoor that unlocked everything

Always read API docs like bedtime stories — you might dream of exploits

🤷 Final Thoughts
Some get $25,000 for 2FA bypasses. I got $1,800 and the satisfaction of saying:

“Yeah… I broke Facebook. A little. 😌”

And hey — if you're reading this and working on bug bounties yourself, don’t underestimate small observations. The weirdest behaviors often lead to the coolest bugs.
